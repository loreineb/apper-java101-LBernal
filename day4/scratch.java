//Fields: stores object state
//Methods: manipulating the state and performing operations
//Constructors: executable during objection creation to set initial stat

//Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
//encapsulation: implementation details of a class are generally hidden
//access modifiers: no access modifier- visible only within it's own package, so private
//if public modifier: visible everywhere
//if private modifier: visible only within the declaring class
// all are usable on members, pero private modifiers di usable on classes

//by design, singular lang names ng classes
//if private yung variable, make public methods to set then get them

//dun sa quiz 1, better if you had another package na pang people lang
//if ganto, don't forget to make the chewfood public para kahit na they're not in the same package, ma-aaccess ni employee
//check the github gist for the codes

//better to put similar things together, like manager and employees in one folder together etc

//a child can only have one parent, pero parents can have several children
//like you can't inherit from both god and human ganun
